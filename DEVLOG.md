# Development log

## 2026-10-27 — vector floating-point compares

- Added the three vector floating-point compare primitives, including their
  recording forms, with the architecture-defined condition-register summary
  and NaN handling.
- Runtime tests: 102 passing
- Recompiler tests: 31 passing
- Coverage: 12,407 of 14,732 functions; 141,034 native blocks
- The port is not yet playable.

## 2026-10-27 — vector single-precision add

- Added a vector single-precision add primitive with round-to-nearest
  semantics, including signed-zero and overflow coverage in tests.
- Runtime tests: 102 passing
- Recompiler tests: 30 passing
- Coverage: 12,384 of 14,732 functions; 140,349 native blocks
- The port is not yet playable.

## 2026-10-27 — vector integer and fused arithmetic primitives

- Added three more vector primitives: unsigned word add and subtract (modulo
  32-bit lanes, no flag changes) and a fused negative multiply-subtract with
  architecture-specified rounding and signed-zero behaviour.
- Runtime tests: 102 passing
- Recompiler tests: 28 passing
- Coverage: 12,325 of 14,732 functions; 139,990 native blocks
- The port is not yet playable.

## 2026-10-27 — vector conversion primitives

- Added two vector floating-point to fixed-point conversion primitives, both
  with round-toward-zero and saturation, checked against the architecture
  specification and an independent emulator implementation.
- Runtime tests: 102 passing
- Recompiler tests: 25 passing
- Coverage: 12,325 of 14,732 functions; 139,990 native blocks
- The port is not yet playable.

## 2026-10-27

Continued private native-porting work. Public updates are intentionally limited
to high-level progress and test status; implementation details remain in the
private workspace.

- Runtime tests: 102 passing
- Recompiler tests: 23 passing
- The port is not yet playable.
